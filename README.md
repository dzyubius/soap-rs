STATUS: WORK IN PROGRESS.

SOAP client for Rust programming language.

This project is not intended to be used in production. It is more for a learning purpose, personally to me it is both Rust and SOAP, what I'm going to explore.

Client is planned to support SOAP 1.2 and SOAP 1.1. Right now I think it would be nice to just have 1.1 and 1.2 adapters for generic codebase.

For teting purposes I use some services from list here.
